## About me
I am an experienced infectious disease epidemiologist and researcher, mainly with field experience in humanitarian crises as the lead epidemiologist for the International Rescue Committee (IRC) from 2011 to 2018 and with WHO. I am currently working for Epicentre and studying for a CIHR-supported Ph.D. at the LSHTM. I completed the Canadian Field Epidemiology Program, an FETP. 
## Research interests
My current research is focused on the surveillance and control of cholera and other epidemic diseases in humanitarian settings, and epidemiological methods and associated causal inference needed to merge modern analytical methods with field epidemiology to conduct observational studies of outbreak and emergency interventions. I also have a long-standing interest in noncommunicable diseases and community health in humanitarian emergencies.
